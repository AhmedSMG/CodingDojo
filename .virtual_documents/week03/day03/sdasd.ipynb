# Objective:
# Select the following collumns for your data frame:
# 'Revenue','Property, Plant & Equipment, Net' and 'Adjusted Close'

# Don't worry if it's new to you. But we can't have spaces in our

# Final Objective:

# In the markdown cell bellow (double click to edit), 
# write your response for which model you think best explains the Adjusted Close prices
# for Digital Realty Trust. Does the equity in the form of Plant, Property and Equipment (PPE)
# best explain our data, or does Revenue? Why? Please refer to the above analyses and/or figures.
