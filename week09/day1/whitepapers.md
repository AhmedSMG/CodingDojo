# Bitcoin Whitepaper


### What problem did Bitcoin solve? How important is the invention of Bitcoin? 

> Bitcoin tries to provide a financial transaction system that is decentralized/distributed allows users to exchange money via the internet. Compared with other trust-based model solutions, Bitcoin enables them to provide a low transaction fee and is faster and much more secure.

How would you explain a blockchain to someone who doesn't know what it is?

> A shared notebook between users and when try to write or edit on it the other should reach conscience on those changes.

Do you think Bitcoin could one day be a world reserve currency? Why or why not?

> Short-term, no, it seems there is a limitation on products/services that accept Bitcoins directly. Long-term, possiably yes, if many services/products accept bitcoin as payments.
