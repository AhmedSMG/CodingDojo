# **KSA P2P Lending Platform Feasibility**

What challenges do you see in P2P lending platforms in Saudi Arabia, do you think that if SMEs cannot get a loan from banks, lending platforms like FORUS present a strong case ?Justify your response by analyzing digital lending ecosystem in middle-east, what value proposition they present to the market, and how SMEs and small startups can be benefitted.In addition, what is the role of regulatory bodies you see, like SAMA or CMA in trying to protect operational risk.

Peer-to-peer lending(crowdfunding) is a type of lending where people or entities provide financial loans to people or enterprises. The lending platform will assign the requesting SMEs a risk grade that will affect the interest rate and sometimes the loan amount. The main issue is that the risk assessment of those SMEs is high and not accurate (many unknown factors)for most startups. This can be shown by the fact only 7% of middle east SMEs have taken a bank loan even though 90% of the enterprise are SMEs([link](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/smefinance)). In one of the scenarios, banks didn’t want to face if a company decided to misuse the funds or didn’t pay, or even the enterprise declared bankruptcy, the bank would get almost nothing. For example, enterprise “A” failed to pay 300,000$ for whatever reason, the only path for investors to get their money is by law hint, lawyers are expensive likely be more than what invested. 

To summarize, the main challenge facing P2P lending:



1. Small amount requested loan.
2. High-risk assessment.
3. A new way to finance (investors hesitate to test new ideas).
4. Protection law to protect P2P investors.

P2P is not attractive for big investors and banks. However, it makes a lot of sense for small-medium investors. Also, the SMEs will be happy to be funded without been partially owned(equity funded) by investors. However, the investors should be provided an assurance that backs them up if the enterprise fails to pays.
