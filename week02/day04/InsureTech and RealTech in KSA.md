    3. Advancement in the real state sector needs a corporation between the enterprise and the regulator’s body. 

        3. A bad corporation example is the announcement of the Saudi Building Code. The issue is that most contractors are not skilled workers and not knowledgeable of the construction code. In addition, these standers have been announced and put in action out of the blue. This discourages engineering offices from taking new projects and delaying or keeping current ones until they comply with code. This resulted in a dramatic increase in cost and an unfavorable business response. ([link](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1949531/business-economy))
